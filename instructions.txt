There are two concept of JS Promise

1. Producing Code
			PC is the code which can take time.
			i.e 
			Async Task/Functions

2. Consuming Code
			CC is the code which wait for a result


A Promise object (PO) is a object that links producing code and consuming code


Promise is a built-in JS Class


JS Class
class MyClass{
		// Members
}

You can create an object of that class


po.then().catch().finally();


then() = success  = resolve

catch() = errors  =  reject
